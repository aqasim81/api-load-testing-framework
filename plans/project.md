# API Load Testing Framework with Scenario Modeling

**Category:** Portfolio Projects

**Problem:** Existing load testing tools (JMeter, k6) require complex
configuration. Most teams skip load testing or do unrealistic
uniform-traffic tests that miss real bottlenecks.

**Solution:** A Python-based load testing framework where you define
user scenarios as code, simulate realistic traffic patterns (spikes,
ramps, diurnal cycles), and get detailed performance reports.

**Target User:** Backend teams, SRE/performance engineering roles

**Why It Stands Out on GitHub:** Performance engineering is a
high-demand, low-supply skill. This project demonstrates you think about
systems at scale and can build developer tools that solve real
operational problems.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Async programming, HTTP protocol internals,
statistical analysis, developer tool UX, performance engineering
methodology

**Estimated Build Time:** 3--4 weeks
